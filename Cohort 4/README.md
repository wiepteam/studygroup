# Study Group Cohort 4

We're excited to announce the upcoming launch of **Study Group Cohort 4**.  
Organized by **Women in Ethereum Protocol (WiEP)**, this cohort provides a structured and collaborative learning experience for Ethereum enthusiasts at all levels. You can learn more about our group with [WiEP Handbook](https://hackmd.io/@poojaranjan/WiEPHandbook).

## Cohort 4 Overview

**Cohort 4** is designed as a comprehensive **10 week program** that takes you deep into the Ethereum protocol, from fundamental concepts to advanced client implementation. This cohort emphasizes hands-on learning through real contributions to Ethereum clients and protocol development.

### Program Structure
- **Duration**: 10 weeks
- **Sessions**: 2 per week
  - **Stand-up Sessions** (1 hour): Weekly progress check-ins, discussion of GitHub issues, and collaborative problem-solving
  - **Guest Lectures** (1-1.5 hours): Deep-dive talks by protocol developers, researchers, and ecosystem leaders
