- **Name/GitHub**: Use your name or handle as a link to your GitHub profile.
- **Week**: Indicate the current cohort week (e.g., "Week 1," "Week 2," etc.).
- **Issue**: List all issues you’re working on (separate multiple issues with commas).
- **Progress update**: Provide a brief (1–2 sentence) update on your progress or any blockers.
- **Outcome**: Summarize the result of your work.
