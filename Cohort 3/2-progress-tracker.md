## Progress Tracker Table

Follow these guidelines when updating the progress tracker table:

- **Name/GitHub**: Use your name or handle as a link to your GitHub profile.
- **Week**: Indicate the current cohort week (e.g., "Week 1," "Week 2," etc.).
- **Issue**: List all issues you‚Äôre working on (separate multiple issues with commas).
- **Progress update**: Provide a brief (1‚Äì2 sentence) update on your progress or any blockers.
- **Outcome**: Summarize the result of your work.

### Week 2 Assignment

To work with the WiEP repo, use this [GitHub guide](./3-github-guide.md#contributing-to-the-wiep-repository).

- Fork and clone the WiEP repo.
- Find your name in the [Progress Tracker Table](#progress-tracker-table) and add your GitHub account, as shown in the example (the first row of the table).
- Open a PR titled `Your-Name: Cohort 3 Week 2 Assignment`.
- Share the link to your PR in the Discord thread for the Week 2 assignment.
- Start exploring issues. If you choose an issue, assign it to yourself in the issue comments and share the link to the issue in the Week 2 Discord thread.

### Week 3 Assignment

- Choose the [issue](./4-issues-guide.md) you will be working on.
- Assign yourself to the issue by leaving a comment on it.
- In the [Progress Tracker Table](#progress-tracker-table), add `Week 3` and a link to your issue, following the pattern in the first row.
- Open a PR titled `Your-Name: Cohort 3 Week 3 Assignment`.
- Share the link to your PR in the Week 3 Assignment post in the #assignments channel.
- Start working on your issue.

### Week 4 Assignment

- Continue working on your issue.
- In the [Progress Tracker Table](#progress-tracker-table), change the week number to 4.
- Add a brief description of your progress update on the issue (1-2 sentences), following the pattern in the first row.
- Open a PR titled `Your-Name: Cohort 3 Week 4 Assignment`.
- Share the link to your PR in the Week 4 Assignment post in the #assignments channel.

### Week 5 Assignment

- At this step, your issue should be assigned to you‚Äîor at least you should have already commented on the issue on GitHub. If you have been assigned by the author of the issue, start working on the code or continue asking additional questions if it's not clear what to do.
- Update your main branch using [step 5](https://github.com/wiepteam/studygroup/blob/main/Cohort%203/3-github-guide.md#5-weekly-updates-syncing-with-upstream-and-making-new-contributions) from GitHubGuide.
- Create a branch named `cohort-3-week-5`.
- Change the week number to 5. 
- Add a brief description of your progress update.
- If you opened or merged a pull request, add the link to it and the corresponding emoji into the Outcome. Available emojis are under the table. Copy the code and paste it.
- Push your updates and open a PR.

‚ö†Ô∏è The following steps are optional‚Äîan additional task for those confident with the previous tasks:

- Compare the upstream progress table and your progress table using the GitHub web interface. Check the first row of the table and wait until the days differ. Then, merge the updates into your branch by running:

```bash
  git fetch upstream
  git merge upstream/main
```

- Resolve any conflicts using your IDE (refer to the Week 5 recording for guidance).

### Week 6 Assignment

- Choose an [EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/) with a Final status from the Core, Networking, or Interface categories. Assign yourself to this EIP in the [EIPs table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kvUCYtmIkDiylyog1NA1DOrazPOldmYH2pBALjo963A/edit?usp=sharing) and ensure that no one else has chosen it before.
- Read the EIP‚Äôs description to understand its main idea and research further to gather additional background information.
- Create a Markdown file in the `Cohort3/EIPs` folder and name it using the format `<Your-Name>-eip-#.md`.
- In your Markdown file, include the EIP‚Äôs name, number, creation date, and authors; add a brief description (1-2 paragraphs) explaining why the EIP was proposed and its general idea.
- Research additional information (e.g., summaries of articles, discussions, and videos) using resources like [Ethereum Magicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/), [Ethereum Research](https://ethresear.ch/), and others, and include links to these resources.
- Prepare a 1-2 minute pitch for the standup call; you may use your Markdown file as a guide or create a one-slide presentation.
- Continue working on your assigned EIP, and update your progress and outcome emoji in the Progress Table, and add your PR (whether it‚Äôs in draft, opened, or merged state) if you already have one.

### Week 7 Assignment

- Update your main branch using [step 5](https://github.com/wiepteam/studygroup/blob/main/Cohort%203/3-github-guide.md#5-weekly-updates-syncing-with-upstream-and-making-new-contributions) from the GitHub Guide.
- Create a branch named `cohort-3-week-7`.
- Update Week 7 in the Progress Table.
- Push your updates and open a PR as early as possible.
- Check for updates from the upstream main:

  ```bash
  git fetch upstream/main
  ```

- Merge the updates if there are any:

  ```bash
  git merge upstream/main
  ```

- If you encounter merge conflicts, resolve them by accepting the incoming changes, as shown in the [Week 5 recording](https://youtu.be/HEx7J63Jfz4?si=S9mwLtGugjqANGfW&t=3303).
- If there are no updates or conflicts from `upstream/main`, continue merging every day of the current week until you encounter a conflict.
- Push your merge by running `git push`.
- Add Week 7, your updates, and the progress emoji to the Progress Table. Push them with `git push`.

### Week 8 Assignment

- Update your main branch using [step 5](https://github.com/wiepteam/studygroup/blob/main/Cohort%203/3-github-guide.md#5-weekly-updates-syncing-with-upstream-and-making-new-contributions) from the GitHub Guide.
- Create a branch named `cohort-3-week-8`.
- Add Week 8, your updates, and the progress emoji to the Progress Table. Push them with `git push`. Open a PR.
- Check for updates from the upstream main:

  ```bash
  git fetch upstream/main
  ```

- Rebase the updates if there are any:

  ```bash
  git rebase upstream/main
  ```

- If you encounter rebase conflicts, resolve them the same way as merge conflicts by accepting the incoming changes, as shown in the [Week 5 recording](https://youtu.be/HEx7J63Jfz4?si=S9mwLtGugjqANGfW&t=3303).
- If there are no updates or conflicts from `upstream/main`, continue rebasing every day of the current week until you encounter a conflict.
