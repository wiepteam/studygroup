## EIP-3675: [Upgrade consensus to Proof-of-Stake](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3675)

**EIP Name:** Upgrade consensus to Proof-of-Stake


**EIP Number:** 3675


**Authors:** Mikhail Kalinin, Danny Ryan, Vitalik Buterin


**Created:** 2021-07-22


## `EIP description`

EIP-3675 defines the transition of the Ethereum network's consensus mechanism from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), known as "The Merge." This upgrade eliminates energy-intensive mining and replaces it with staking, where validators lock up ETH to participate in block creation and validation. This shift aims to enhance energy efficiency, improve security, and pave the way for further scaling solutions.

The Merge integrates the existing Ethereum mainnet with the Beacon Chain, a PoS system launched earlier. Post-Merge, the Beacon Chain becomes the consensus layer, while Ethereum handles execution. Validators propose and attest to new blocks; rewards and penalties incentivize good behavior. This transition marks a critical step toward a more sustainable and scalable Ethereum.
